        "# **Python Basics**\n",
        "**Q.1   What is Python, and why is it popular?**\n",
        "- Python is a programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented, and considered to be high-level.\n",
        "- It is one of the easiest yet most useful programming languages and is widely used in the software industry. People use Python for Competitive Programming, Web Development, and creating software.\n",
        "- It is popular because of its simplicity and readability,versatility,huge community support and it's powerful libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.2   What is an interpreter in Python?**\n",
        "- An interpreter in Python is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line. Instead of compiling the entire program into machine code (like C or Java does with a compiler), the interpreter translates each line of Python into an intermediate form and executes it immediately.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.3   What are pre-defined keywords in Python?**\n",
        "- Pre-defined keywords in Python are reserved words that have special meaning in the language. These words are used to define the syntax and structure of Python programs, and we cannot use them as variable names, function names, or identifiers.\n",
        "For example :- if, elif, else, for, def, while, return etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.4  Can keywords be used as variable names?**\n",
        "- No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.5  What is mutability in Python?**\n",
        "- In Python, mutability refers to the ability of an object to be modified after it's created.\n",
        "-Mutable objects can be changed in place, meaning their content or state can be altered without creating a new object. Examples: List, Disctionary, Set.\n",
        "- Immutable objects, on the other hand, cannot be changed after they are created. Any operation that appears to modify an immutable object actually creates a new object. Examples: Integers, Floats, Strings, Boolean, Tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.6  Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?**\n",
        "- Lists are mutable because they are designed to be flexible, allowing elements to be added, removed, or changed after the list is created—this is useful for dynamic data handling.\n",
        "-Tuples are immutable by design to ensure data integrity and make them hashable, which allows their use as keys in dictionaries and elements in sets. This immutability provides a guarantee that their contents won’t change, which can lead to safer, more predictable code and potential performance optimizations by Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.7   What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?**\n",
        "- In Python, == checks value equality, meaning it compares whether the values of two objects are the same, while is checks identity, meaning it compares whether two references point to the exact same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.8   What are logical operators in Python?**\n",
        "- Logical operators in Python are used to combine conditional statements and evaluate their truth value. The logical operators are:\n",
        "\n",
        "**and:** Returns True if both operands are True.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: True and False returns False\n",
        "\n",
        "**or:** Returns True if at least one of the operands is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: True or False returns True\n",
        "\n",
        "**not:** Reverses the truth value of the operand (negation).\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: not True returns False\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.9    What is type casting in Python?**  \n",
        "- Type casting in Python refers to the process of converting a variable from one data type to another. This can be done explicitly using functions like int(), float(), str(), etc., to convert between types such as integers, floats, and strings. For example, int(\"10\") converts the string \"10\" into the integer 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.10  What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?**\n",
        "- **Implicit Type Casting :** This happens automatically when Python converts one data type to another without the programmer's intervention. It usually occurs when a smaller data type is assigned to a larger data type (e.g., an integer to a float). Python does this to avoid data loss.\n",
        "-**Explicit Type Casting:** This is when the programmer manually converts one data type to another using type conversion functions like int(), float(), str(), etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.11   What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?**\n",
        "- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to allow the program to make decisions based on certain conditions. They enable the execution of specific blocks of code depending on whether a given condition evaluates to True or False. This helps in controlling the flow of the program, making it more dynamic and responsive to different inputs or situations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.12  How does the elif statement work?**\n",
        "- The elif statement in Python stands for \"else if\" and is used to check multiple conditions after an initial if condition. It allows your program to choose between several blocks of code to execute, depending on which condition is True.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.13  What is the difference between for and while loops?**\n",
        "- **for**  loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to loop. It iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
        "-**while** loop is used when you want to repeat a block of code as long as a condition is true, and you don’t necessarily know how many times it will run.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Q.14   Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.**\n",
        "- A while loop is more suitable when the number of iterations is not known in advance and depends on a condition that changes dynamically, such as waiting for user input, checking for a sensor value, or validating login attempts.\n",
        "**Scenario: User Login Attempt**\n",
        "-Imagine you want to keep asking a user to enter the correct password until they get it right. You don’t know how many attempts they'll need, so a while loop is ideal.\n",
        "\n",
        "correct_password = \"python123\"\n",
        "\n",
        "user_input = \"\"\n",
        "\n",
        "while user_input != correct_password:\n",
        "\n",
        "          user_input = input(\"Enter password: \")\n",
        "\n",
